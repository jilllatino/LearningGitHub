## What to do

### Know your Audience
Technical writing should be concise and easily understood by the target audience.  Usage of archaic words and unusual grammatical constructs will only cause confusion.

### Reduce the Clutter
Ensure that superfluous and irrelevant details are not included in the document.  This will often derail the audience and cause confusion and noise.

### Document As Code
Store documents in Git.  In doing so, you create an audit trail of changes as well as provide an easy way to share the documents.  

In Git, organize the documents such that it is easy to find.    Reduce the clutter by storing images in a subfolder called `_images`.
