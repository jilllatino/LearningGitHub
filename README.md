## What not to do

### First Person / Second Person
Avoid referring to the first or second person.  
The following is a list to avoid

| Route Type | Strategy
|:-----|:-----
|lambda| Lambda Function name will be variable and based on a Staging Variable (xdxcintgroute).  The region for the Lambda Function will not be variable.  All possible Lambda functions for any one API will reside in the same AWS region.  (This is an AWS limitation as the region cannot be variable)





### First Person / Second PersonAvoid referring to the first or second person.  Avoid "you", "I", etc.
